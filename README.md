Animédas is a website that I created to provide high-quality and free anime icons for personal and commercial use. 
The main goal of this project is to offer a diverse and comprehensive collection of anime-inspired icons that can be used on various platforms such as websites, apps, games, and more.

Animédas features an intuitive and easy-to-use interface where users can browse through different categories of icons and download them for free.

Furthermore, Animédas icons are regularly updated with new additions,keeping the collection fresh and interesting. 
The website also offers the option to request new icons that can be added to the collection.

Animédas is a project in constant evolution and I am always working to improve the quality and quantity of the available icons. 
I hope this website can be useful to you in your projects and I appreciate your visit and use of the resources available here.

If you have any suggestions or questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you for using Animédas!
